The aim of this project is to develop a COMET implementation which does not require a custom server, but can run in native IIS.

Most COMET implementations require a custom server as ASP.NET's threading model (pooled threads) does not promote scalability for COMET applications.  

Long polling is supported under the [http://svn.cometd.org/trunk/bayeux/bayeux.html Bayeux protocol], using Asynchronous Http Handlers in ASP.NET.

The project uses [http://jetbrains.com/teamcity Jetbrains TeamCity] for continuous integration, hosted at [http://teamcity.codebetter.com/project.html?projectId=project59 TeamCity.CodeBetter.Com]
