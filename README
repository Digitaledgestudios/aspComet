The aim of this project is to develop a COMET implementation which does not require a custom server, but can run in native IIS.

Most COMET implementations require a custom server as ASP.NET's threading model (pooled threads) does not promote scalability for COMET applications.

Long polling is supported under the Bayeux protocol, using Asynchronous Http Handlers in ASP.NET.

The project uses Jetbrains TeamCity for continuous integration, hosted at TeamCity.CodeBetter.Com
